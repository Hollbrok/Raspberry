# This is the repository with my projects for GET (General engineering training) in MIPT (2 sem).

	It was experimental progam of GET, so below you can see my marks for projects on it:

| Lesson       	| Mark |
| ------------ 	| ---- |
| LibreOffice  	| 9    |
| MATLAB  		| 10   |
| Git	  		| 10   |
| GPIO  		| 10   |
| DAC  			| 10   |
| ADC  			| 10   |
| Soldering		| 10   |
| Capacitor		| 10   |

So I got my final mark for this course: __10__ out of __10__.
